The first time my idea was to move ```HooplaClient``` to a `lib` because I prefer to use helpers to expose data for views. Then I used ```ActiveResource``` to manage a third party data like a similar way to ActiveRecord, then I had some problems with ```PUT``` and ```POST``` because I needed to pass different headers depending of the verb and the version that I was using doesn't support that in a clean way, so I preferred to Use ActiveModel thinking I don't need to use an external gem, and in the same time I can keep the same philosophy of ActiveRecord (```save```, ```find``` and ```all```)
